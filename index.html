    <h1>GODS OF THE OCEAN</h1>

    <h2>NIAMH</h2>
    <p class="paragraph"> <a href="niamh.html">
            <img src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/b0490f56-50e2-43b7-a7aa-f378bdb5458a/grid_0.png" alt="prince"

        Niamh is not just a goddess of the tides and currents, she is a symbol of the ocean's ever-changing nature. Her
        mermaid-like form, with her shimmering tail and hair the color of seafoam, embodies the beauty and mystery of
        the sea. Her eyes, the deep blue of the shifting tides, hold the secrets of the ocean's depths and the power of
        its currents.

        Niamh is a goddess of capricious nature, a being who can be both kind and cruel. To sailors, she is both a
        blessing and a curse, with the power to aid them in their journeys or bring them to ruin. But those who know her
        understand that her moods are a reflection of the sea itself, a force of nature that cannot be controlled or
        predicted.

    <h2>TRITON</h2>
    <p class="paragraph_2"> <a href="triton.html">
            <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1050792777660780544/1077366864717545532/neptuneboy666_gyotaku_Film_screengrab_the_merfolk_emperor_sci-f_7ff68c60-3218-4130-9c4b-3c7336678897.png"
                alt="prince" width="50%"> </a>
        Triton is not just a god of sea creatures, he is the embodiment of the ocean's might and mystery. His trident is
        not just a tool, but a symbol of his power and command over all that dwell beneath the waves. His presence is
        felt in the roaring of the tides, the whispers of the currents, and the songs of the sea creatures who call him
        their lord.

        Triton is a deity of great wisdom and strength, a protector of all who make their living on the water. He is
        often called upon by fishermen and sailors to guide them through the treacherous waters, and he never fails to
        deliver them safely to their destination.

    <h2>THALASSA</h2>
    <p class="paragraph"> <a href="THALASSA.html">
            <img src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/8b83c629-549b-4ae2-ac16-25fe5cb45819/grid_0.png" alt="prince"
                width="50%"> </a>
        Thalassa is a goddess of the sea unlike any other, for she is the very embodiment of the ocean itself. Her form
        is fluid and ever-changing, a reflection of the constant motion of the waves. Her voice is the roar of the surf,
        the sound of the sea crashing against the shore. She is a goddess of great power and mystery, a being who
        commands the awe and respect of all who behold her.

        To see Thalassa is to witness the beauty and terror of the sea. Her eyes are the deep blue of the ocean's
        depths, holding the secrets of the abyss within them. Her hair is the color of the foam that gathers on the
        waves, a cascade of shimmering light that sparkles in the sun. She is a goddess of duality, for she can be both
        gentle and fierce, kind and cruel, depending on the whims of the tides.
