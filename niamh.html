    <h1>NIAMH</h1>
    <div class="container"><img src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/b0490f56-50e2-43b7-a7aa-f378bdb5458a/grid_0.png"

    <p class="sudpar">
        Niamh is not just a goddess of the tides and currents, she is a symbol of the ocean's ever-changing nature. Her
        mermaid-like form, with her shimmering tail and hair the color of seafoam, embodies the beauty and mystery of
        the sea. Her eyes, the deep blue of the shifting tides, hold the secrets of the ocean's depths and the power of
        its currents.

        Niamh is a goddess of capricious nature, a being who can be both kind and cruel. To sailors, she is both a
        blessing and a curse, with the power to aid them in their journeys or bring them to ruin. But those who know her
        understand that her moods are a reflection of the sea itself, a force of nature that cannot be controlled or
        predicted.

        To be in Niamh's presence is to feel the ebb and flow of the ocean's tides, to hear the gentle lapping of the
        waves against the shore. Her voice is like the murmur of the sea breeze, a soothing sound that belies the power
        and force that lies beneath it. She is a goddess of deep wisdom, a being who understands the secrets of the sea
        and the mysteries that lie beyond our understanding.

        For those who seek her guidance, Niamh is a light in the darkness, a guide through the treacherous waters of the
        ocean. She holds the power of the currents in her hands, and with a flick of her tail, she can set a ship on
        course or dash it against the rocks. To know her is to understand the ever-changing nature of the sea, and to
        respect the power and majesty of the ocean that lies beyond.
